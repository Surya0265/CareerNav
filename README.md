# CareerNav

CareerNav is an open-source career navigation platform that helps users analyze resumes, extract skills, plan career timelines, receive job recommendations, and find learning resources — all in one place. The project combines a modern React + TypeScript frontend, a Node/Express backend with MongoDB, and optional Python helpers for AI/ML integrations.

This README provides a detailed description of the project, its purpose, architecture, directory layout, developer run instructions, API highlights, and deployment notes.

## Project summary

CareerNav aims to give job seekers actionable career guidance by combining resume parsing, structured skill extraction, AI-backed career plan generation, timeline creation, and job/learning recommendations. The platform stores user resumes, detected skills, and saved timelines, and provides authenticated pages (dashboard, resume upload, jobs, timeline) along with public landing and auth pages.

---

## Architecture & technology stack

- Frontend: React + TypeScript (Vite), Tailwind CSS, React Router, React Query
- Backend: Node.js + Express, MongoDB (Mongoose models), middleware for auth and file uploads
- Optional Python helpers: `backend/utils/*.py` — used for certain AI/ML workflows (Gemini helpers)
- Storage: uploaded resumes stored locally under `backend/uploads/` by default; can be swapped for cloud object storage
- Third-party integrations: YouTube Data API, email/SMS providers, AI APIs

Notes:
- `frontend2` is the active UI; `frontend` is legacy/archival and may contain older code.
- `backend/utils/` contains AI/ML helper scripts — review carefully before running in production.

---

## Main features and user flows

1. Authentication
   - Sign up, verify email, log in, forgot/reset password. Uses JWT tokens for protected routes.

2. Resume upload & parsing
   - Users upload resumes; backend extracts structured information (skills, contacts, sections) and returns parsed data for user validation.

3. Skill management & normalization
   - Extracted skills are normalized and saved to a central skills collection; user can edit or remove detected skills.

4. Job recommendations
   - Recommendations are generated based on saved skills or resume content — returned as ranked job lists with scores.

5. AI-driven career planning
   - Uses AI helpers to generate a timeline/plan (milestones, learning resources) and returns visual Mermaid code for flowcharts.

6. Timeline management
   - Users create, save, and complete timeline plans and timeline items (milestones). Plans may be regenerated by AI.

7. Bookmarks & learning resources
   - Save jobs and learning resources (including YouTube videos) and later access/bookmark them.

8. Analytics
   - Track user events (optional) for product insights.

---

## Running the project locally

Prerequisites:
- Node 16+ and npm
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)
- (Optional) Python 3.9+ for AI helper scripts

Backend (recommended steps):

1. Create a `.env` file inside `backend/` with required variables (example below).
2. Install dependencies and run the server:

```powershell
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend (recommended steps):

```powershell
cd frontend2
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the frontend at the Vite URL shown in the terminal (commonly http://localhost:5173) and ensure `VITE_API_BASE` points to your backend.

---

## Environment variables (example)

Place these in `backend/.env` for development:

```
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/careernav
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
PORT=4000
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.example.com
EMAIL_USER=foo
EMAIL_PASS=bar
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_key
```

Frontend environment variables (frontend2/.env):

```
VITE_API_BASE=http://localhost:4000/api
```

---

## Key files and responsibilities

- `backend/routes/` — groups of related endpoints (auth, resume, jobs, timeline, youtube, ai)
- `backend/controllers/` — core request handling business logic
- `backend/models/` — Mongoose schemas and model responsibilities
- `frontend2/src/app/App.tsx` — route registration and protected-route logic
- `frontend2/src/components/layout/AppLayout.tsx` — the main app layout (sidebar + header)
- `frontend2/src/pages/` — page-level components (Dashboard, ResumeUpload, JobRecommendations, Timeline)
- `scripts/generate_use_cases.js` — scans project to auto-generate use-case documentation

---

## API endpoints overview (high-level)

The backend exposes several grouped endpoints (check `backend/routes` for exact names):

- Auth: `/user/signup`, `/user/login`, `/user/verify`, `/user/forgot-password`, `/user/reset-password`
- Resume: `/resume/upload`, `/resume/latest`, `/resume/finalize`
- Skills: `/skills/extract`, `/skills`, `/skills/:skillId`
- Jobs: `/jobs-by-resume`, `/jobs-by-skills`, `/jobs-search`
- AI: `/analyze-resume`, `/analyze-existing` (under ai routes)
- Timeline: `/timeline/generate-plan`, `/timeline/:id`, `/timeline/complete-phase`
- YouTube: `/youtube/recommendations`

Protected endpoints require Authorization header with a valid Bearer JWT token.

---

## Inferred database entities and relationships (summary)

Primary entities: `User`, `Resume`, `Skill`, `ResumeSkill` (join), `Job`, `JobRecommendation`, `Bookmark`, `TimelinePlan`, `TimelineItem`, `LearningResource`, `YouTubeRecommendation`, `Analytics`, `Content`.

Key relationships:
- `User 1 -- * Resume`
- `Resume * -- * Skill` (via `ResumeSkill` join)
- `User 1 -- * JobRecommendation`
- `JobRecommendation * -- 1 Job`
- `User 1 -- * Bookmark`
- `User 1 -- * TimelinePlan`, `TimelinePlan 1 -- * TimelineItem`

Note: A more detailed ER diagram can be generated using the included scripts or by consulting `backend/models`.

---

## Testing, linting, and developer scripts

- `frontend2`: `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, `npm test` (if tests are present)
- `backend`: `npm run dev`, `npm test` (if tests exist)
- `scripts/generate_use_cases.js`: generate `USE_CASES.md` by scanning frontend and backend routes

Consider adding a root-level script to orchestrate starting both services for convenience (e.g., using `concurrently`).

---

## Deployment notes

- Use a managed MongoDB instance (Atlas) in production.
- Build and host the frontend on a static site host (Netlify, Vercel) or serve from the backend.
- Containerize the backend (Docker) and deploy with environment variables securely stored.

---

## Contributing

- Create feature branches from `main`.
- Add tests and run linters before PR. Document breaking changes in PR descriptions.

---

If you want I can:
- Generate `docs/schema.puml` or `docs/schema.sql` from the inferred schema and add it to `docs/`.
- Add convenience npm scripts to start frontend and backend concurrently from the repo root.
